Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

Background:
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, I will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
1.	Preprocess the raw data
2.	Tune the models
3.	Compare two or more models
________________________________________
Preprocess the Data:

•	Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.
•	Performed feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
•	Used MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
•	Separated the data into training and testing data.
Tune Model Parameters
•	UsedGridSearch to tune model parameters.
•	Tuned and compared at least two different classifiers.
Reporting
•	Created a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about my findings and any assumptions I made based on my model.

Considerations Thoughout The Process:

•	Start by cleaning the data, removing unnecessary columns, and scaling the data.
•	Not all variables are significant be sure to remove any insignificant variables.
•	Make sure your sklearn package is up to date.
•	Try a simple model fi

Submission:

Create a Jupyter Notebook for each model and host the notebooks on GitHub.
Create a file for your best model and push to GitHub
Include a README.md file that summarizes your assumptions and findings.
Submit the link to your GitHub project to Bootcamp Spot.
Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
